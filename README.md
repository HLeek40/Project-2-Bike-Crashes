Project 2: Bicycle Crashes in Chapel Hill, NC
Group Members: Erin Pisters, Tim Goldman, Ken Synder, Heather Leek
The team will be analyzing bicycle crashes in Chapel Hill, NC to determine specific patterns in the data.  The team would like to investigate if there is a higher propensity for bicycle crashes on specific days of the week and around specific times of the year such as holidays.  The team will also determine if the they can identify reasons for specific types crashes.
The team will utilize bicycle crash data from the data.gov website.  Per the website, the data originated from police-reported crashes and covers January 2007 through December 2013.
 
Field level dataset detail may be found within our team Github repository:
https://github.com/HLeek40/Project-2-Bike-Crashes/blob/master/data.txt
The team would like to provide 3 different visuals:
1.	A city street map of bicycle crash locations with markers and tooltips.
2.	A calendar that contains a heat map indicating the frequency of crashes on particular days of the week and near specific events/times of year.
3.	Word cloud with the frequency of crash types in a jumbotron header for our interactive website.
4.	A series of graphs that visualize information from the dataset such as linear regression, pie chart and bar chart.
Expected charts and antipated layout are contained in attached PowerPoint file: Team Project Inspiration.
